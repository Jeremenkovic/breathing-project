# breathing_project   

A new Flutter project.

The project consists of a few animations and the main focus is on animation controllers.
We can do most of this project with lottie files (json animations) but I wanted to show my animation coding skills in this, so I made a version with my animation and with lottie animation (Breathing Circle only).

The projects consists of 3 files plus main. Countdown_timer.dart is where the heavy lifting is, the rest are just helping widgets and assets.

I implemented a lottie file for breathing circle animation but made breather.dart as a animation for that same widget.

Libraries used:
cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2
lottie: ^2.0.0
  audioplayers: ^1.1.1

To run the app just pull it or open .zip, go pub run and you are good to go, ready for flutter run!
