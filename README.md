# breathing

A new Flutter project.
95% DONE PROJECT.

The project consists of a few animations and the main focus is on animation controllers.
We can do most of this project with lottie files (json animations) but I wanted to show my animation coding skills.

The projects consists of 3 files plus main. Countdown_timer.dart is where the heavy lifting is and I have a little problem with configuring lottiecontrollers (from line 117 to 150 in countdown_timer.dart) but it will be fixed.

I implemented a lottie file for breathing circle animation but made breather.dart as a animation for that same widget.

Libraries used:
cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2
lottie: ^2.0.0
  audioplayers: ^1.1.1
